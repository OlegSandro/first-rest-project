**Database**

---

To create a clean database with 2 tables inside (`dictionary` and `user`) you must execute the following commands in SQL editor of MySQL Workbench. 

The creation of the database `service`:
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA `service` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci ;
```

The creation of the table `dictionary`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `service`.`dictionary` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `discriminator` VARCHAR(15) NULL,
  `name` VARCHAR(31) NOT NULL,
  `ext_id` INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
```

The creation of the table `user`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `service`.`user` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `login` VARCHAR(31) NOT NULL,
  `password` VARCHAR(63) NOT NULL,
  `id_role` INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
```

The adding of a new foreign key for table `user`:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `service`.`user`
ADD INDEX `fk_dictionary_user_idx` (`id_role` ASC) VISIBLE;
;
ALTER TABLE `service`.`user`
ADD CONSTRAINT `fk_dictionary_user`
  FOREIGN KEY (`id_role`)
  REFERENCES `service`.`dictionary` (`id`)
  ON DELETE CASCADE
  ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

In result you must get the following graphic schema of the database:

To populate the new clean database `service` by data you must execute the following commands in SQL editor of MySQL Workbench.

The creation of 2 records in the table `dictionary`:
```sql
INSERT INTO `service`.`dictionary` (`discriminator`, `name`) VALUES ('role', 'user');
INSERT INTO `service`.`dictionary` (`discriminator`, `name`) VALUES ('role', 'admin');
```

The creation of 1 record in  the table `user`:
```sql
INSERT INTO `service`.`user` (`login`, `password`, `id_role`) VALUES ('user', 'qwerty', '2');
```

**Project Structure**

---

The graphic view of project structure tree is shown below:

Next you can see overall explanations about each important package or file:

> `src\main\resources` – resources directory

> `src\main\java` – sources directory

The main files, which directory `src\main\resources` contains:

* `db.properties` - file with definitions of MySQL, Hibernate and c3p0 library connection pooling properties

The main packages and files, which directory `src\main\java` contains in the package `com.example`:

> package `entities` - `@Entity` classes
* `User` - model class corresponding `user` table in the database

> package `model` - \[deprecated\] model classes from old project `helloworld`
* `Message` - \[deprecated\] model class for old project `helloworld` performance

> package `controller` - `@Controller` classes
* `UserController` - controller class for `User` class
* `MessageController` - \[deprecated\] controller class for old project `helloworld` performance

> package `service` - `@Service` classes
* `UserService` - service interface for `User` class
* `UserServiceImpl` - service class for for `User` class

> package `dao` - `@Repository` classes
* `UserDao` - DAO interface for `User` class
* `UserDaoImpl` - DAO class for `User` class

> package `confiruration` - `@Configuration` classes
* `WebConfiguration` - class for configuring the Spring MVC for application
* `AppConfiguration` - class for configuring the Hibernate ORM with Spring MVC application
* `WebInitializer` - class for initialization of Servlet container (used instead of web.xml)

**Building, Deployment and Running**

---

To build, deploy and run the app you must execute the following commands for Maven.

Perform this to trigger WAR packaging:

`mvn clean install`

Perform this command to deploy the WAR automatically and run it on embedded Tomcat:

`mvn tomcat7:run`

---
**Testing**

---
For app testing it is useful to apply [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) software. It lets you to send HTTP requests of any nature. We are interested in GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods now.


`Create a user in the database`

Send POST via Postman (necessarily with JSON in HTTP body, which corresponds to JSON of User) to create the user in the database:

`http://localhost:8080/user/`

with the body 

```json
{
    "login": "john",
    "password": "abcdef",
    "id_role": 1
}
```


`Read the user from the database`

Send GET via Postman to get the user from the database with `id = 1`:

`http://localhost:8080/user/1`


`Update the user in the database`

Send PUT via Postman (necessarily with JSON in HTTP body, which corresponds to JSON of User) to modify the user in the database with `id = 2`:

`http://localhost:8080/user/2`

with the body 

```json
{
    "login": "maria",
    "password": "20122012",
    "id_role": 1
}
```


`Delete the user from the database`

Send DELETE via Postman to remove the user from the database with `id = 2`:

`http://localhost:8080/user/2`


`Read all users from the database`

Send GET via Postman to get all user from the database:

`http://localhost:8080/user/`
